# logicap

A **logicap** is a "Logical Capsule" that contains some logical functionality with internal state.
Think of it like a method on a class that has access to properties on the class.

All **logicap's** are factory functions returning the method with the internal state.

The **logicap's** are used to reduce code in the main grid component.
