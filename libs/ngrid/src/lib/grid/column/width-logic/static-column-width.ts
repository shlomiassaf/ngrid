 * The default column width is the width for all columns that does not have a width setting defined.
 * In addition, a `minimumRowWidth` is calculated, which represents the minimum width required width of the row, i.e. table.
 *
 * The `StaticColumnWidthLogic` does not take into account real-time DOM measurements (especially box-model metadata), hence "static".
 * It performs the calculation based on "dry" `PblColumn` metadata input from the user.
 *
 * The `StaticColumnWidthLogic` is less accurate and best used as a measurement baseline followed by a more accurate calculation.
 * This is why it outputs a default column width and not a column specific width.

   * Returns the calculated default width for a column.
   * This is the width for columns that does not have a specific width, adjusting them to fit the table.
   * It's important to run this method AFTER aggregating all columns through `addColumn()`.
   * The result contains 2 values, pct and px.
   * pct is the total width in percent that the column should spread taking into account columns with fixed % width.
   * px is the total width in pixels that the column should shrink taking into account columns with fixed pixel width.
   *
   * The algorithm is simple:
   *  1) Sum all columns with fixed percent width
   *  2) From the entire row width (100%) deduct the total fixed width (step 1).
   *     This result represents the % left for all columns without a fixed width (percent and pixel).
   *  3) Sum all columns with fixed pixel width.
   *     The result represent the total amount of width in pixel taken by columns with fixed width.
   *  4) Count all the columns without a fixed width.
   *
   *  For 2 & 3 we get values that we need to spread even between all of the columns without fixed width (percent and pixel).
   *  The exact width is the total percent left (2) minus the total width in pixel taken by columns with fixed with.
   *  We now need to divide the result from 2 & 3 by the result from 4.
   *
   * Both values should be used together on the `width` style property using the `calc` function:
   * e.g.: `calc(${pct}% - ${px}px)`
   *
   * This value is calculated every time it is called, use it once all columns are added.
