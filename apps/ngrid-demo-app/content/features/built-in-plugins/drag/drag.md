# Drag & Drop Plugin

The Drag & Drop plugin is a plugin that provides drag & drop capabilities to elements in the grid.

In general, the plugin allows dragging of:

- Columns
- Rows

## Column Dragging

In Columns we mean cells, more specifically **headers cells**.

The plugging comes with support for specific behaviors:

- Column Resize
- Column Reorder

And support for **custom behaviors** through column drop containers where you can
define a container which receives columns and takes actions when columns are added/removed for the container.
