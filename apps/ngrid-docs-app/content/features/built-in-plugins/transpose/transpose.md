# Transpose

W> Transpose DOES NOT support virtual scroll, if your datasource is large performance will suffer.
W> Because transposing is rendering of the datasource vertically, i.e. - each column is a row,
W> and because the table does not support vertical virtual scroll, transpose will not apply virtual scroll.
