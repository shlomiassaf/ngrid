## Highlights

### Sass
Sass theming API has been reworked so that clients can take advantage of @use. This includes:

- A single entry point into `@pebula/ngrid`, `@pebula/ngrid-material` and `@pebula/ngrid-bootstrap`
- Renamed functions, mixins, and variables to be a better reflection of what they do
- Applications still using node-sass will need to switch to the sass package
For more information, check out [the new material theming guide](https://github.com/angular/components/blob/25665dcc219fbbb76d0ba7f79982672500f78644/guides/theming.md) and [ngrid's theming docs](https://shlomiassaf.github.io/ngrid/concepts/theming/introduction).
- For convinience, legacy theming API is still availavle at `@pebula/ngrid/theming`, `@pebula/ngrid-material/theming` and `@pebula/ngrid-bootstrap/theming`. The legacy API will be removed in v5.0.0

### IVY APF v12

Starting from version 4 of **nGrid**, the library is packaged using the new IVY [**A**ngular **P**acakge **F**ormat (v12)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZC2rcpxffTDfRDs6p1cfbmKNLA6x5O-NtkJglDaBVs).

Compilation is done in `ViewEngine` mode.  
While angular recommends compiling in [partial-ivy mode](https://angular.io/guide/creating-libraries#transitioning-libraries-to-partial-ivy-format), it has several limitations:

- Support is still not wide-spread so several tools will not load **nGrid** (StackBlitz, CodeSandbox, etc...)
- Applcations still running in `ViewEnginge` will not be able to run **nGrid** while IVY application can use NGCC
- NGCC in v12 is still fully operational, so why limit?
- `@angular/components` (material) is also publishing v12 libaraies in `ViewEngine`

However, as part of the CI process we still compile with partial-ivy mode enabled to catch errors since it is still new and has [it's quirks](https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/42208) which required some shellow API changes to work around it's issues. There should be no effect and used to ensure futute competability, however, if you experience strange behaviour please report.

In addition, symboles exposes in public modules are now required to be exposed in the public API as well. This resulted in multiple symboles which were previously private now exposed.  

### Aligned with v12 of the angular eco-system

Library is now on par with version 12 of `angular`, `@angular/cdk` and `@angular/components` (material).

Since `nGrid@v4` is IVY compiled and the CDK does not support previous versions, v4 of **nGrid** will only run on angular version 12 and up.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** To reduce clutter in the main packge the configuration symbols moved to `@pebula/ngrid/core`.
At this point all symbols were re-exported from the main module so this no effect there. However, if you've extended on of the symbols using augmentation you will need to update the augmentation module path.
* **ngrid:** To reduce clutter in the main packge the datasource symbols (all) and some of the column model symbols moved to `@pebula/ngrid/core`.
At this point all symbols we're re-exported from the main module so this no effect there. However, if you've extended on of the symbols using augmentation you will need to update the augmentation module path.
* **ngrid:** Since the registry and it's type mapping symbols are for intenral or plugin use they are now part of the core pacakge. Currently the single/multi directives are still in the main package but they might also be moved in a later phase
* **ngrid:** If you've used `unrx` in your code, it is not located in `@pebula/ngrid/core` since it is not for used by "regular" users, only required for plugin authoring.
* **ngrid:** Pagination types have moved from `@pebula/ngrid` to `@pebula/ngrid/core` as part of the cleanup process to simplify the main package. `@pebula/ngrid` re-exports the interfaces and types but the concrete implementations for `PblPagingPaginator` and `PblTokenPaginator` are now in the core pacakge as they are
not intended to be used by "regular" users, only plugin authors.
* **ngrid:** Binding `[grid]` and `[row]` is no longer required. Same for `detailRow` and `infiniteRow`
* **ngrid:** `resize-observer-polyfill` is no longer a peerDependency and is not required by the library. If you want polyfill support please import the polyfill using polyfill.ts
* **ngrid:** `prop` and `span` are deprecated from `PblColumnGroupDefinition` and will be removed from version 4.0.0
`prop` and `span` are removed from `PblColumnGroup` and instread columnIds list is used
* **ngrid:** If you used the hideColumns property (setter only) via code and not via html binding it will no longer work.
Instead, use the new api to add/remove columns.
If you used it via bindings, it will still work but it is not recommended because other plugins that use the API
will override values from the array provided.

* **ngrid:** move registry to core package ([55e8f31](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/55e8f311691394cb2fe2bcbbd76fa5169d72ad15))
* **ngrid:** moved pagination types to core ([cad0f5b](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/cad0f5bf13b9b1a57dcf304be0da797c524820be))


### Performance Improvements

* **ngrid:** disable wheel mode when virtual scroll paging is active ([25d269e](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/25d269eb3a79c417b96a6e1ce17215e949a7cbb2))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** To reduce clutter in the main packge the configuration symbols moved to `@pebula/ngrid/core`.
At this point all symbols were re-exported from the main module so this no effect there. However, if you've extended on of the symbols using augmentation you will need to update the augmentation module path.
* **ngrid:** To reduce clutter in the main packge the datasource symbols (all) and some of the column model symbols moved to `@pebula/ngrid/core`.
At this point all symbols we're re-exported from the main module so this no effect there. However, if you've extended on of the symbols using augmentation you will need to update the augmentation module path.
* **ngrid:** Since the registry and it's type mapping symbols are for intenral or plugin use they are now part of the core pacakge. Currently the single/multi directives are still in the main package but they might also be moved in a later phase
* **ngrid:** If you've used `unrx` in your code, it is not located in `@pebula/ngrid/core` since it is not for used by "regular" users, only required for plugin authoring.
* **ngrid:** Pagination types have moved from `@pebula/ngrid` to `@pebula/ngrid/core` as part of the cleanup process to simplify the main package. `@pebula/ngrid` re-exports the interfaces and types but the concrete implementations for `PblPagingPaginator` and `PblTokenPaginator` are now in the core pacakge as they are
not intended to be used by "regular" users, only plugin authors.



# 3.0.0-alpha.2 (2020-12-03)

### Performance Improvements

* **ngrid:** rebuild columns/cells inside rows when invalidating ([35bbea8](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/35bbea8cd15105910f5b45584825ba3fd7848145))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** Binding `[grid]` and `[row]` is no longer required. Same for `detailRow` and `infiniteRow`
* **ngrid:** `resize-observer-polyfill` is no longer a peerDependency and is not required by the library. If you want polyfill support please import the polyfill using polyfill.ts
* **ngrid:** `prop` and `span` are deprecated from `PblColumnGroupDefinition` and will be removed from version 4.0.0

`prop` and `span` are removed from `PblColumnGroup` and instread columnIds list is used
* **ngrid:** If you used the hideColumns property (setter only) via code and not via html binding it will no longer work.
Instead, use the new api to add/remove columns.
If you used it via bindings, it will still work but it is not recommended because other plugins that use the API
will override values from the array provided.

# 2.0.0-rc.1 (2020-03-15)


### Bug Fixes

* **ngrid:** allow running in ViewEngine mode (fixes [#84](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/issues/84)) ([#86](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/issues/86)) ([fad8409](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/fad8409))

# 1.0.0-rc.14 (2020-01-16)


### Bug Fixes

* **ngrid:** unable to use cdk-drag with ngrid ([20250cb](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/20250cb)), closes [#72](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/issues/72)



# 1.0.0-rc.13 (2019-12-10)

# 1.0.0-rc.12 (2019-11-22)


### Code Refactoring

* **ngrid:** terminology, change from 'table'  to 'grid' ([4ca1a1e](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/4ca1a1e))

* **ngrid:** refactor(ngrid): width in isolation ([a6d9290](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/a6d9290))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** This refactor changes the terminology used by the library from legacy "table" references to "grid" references.
This refactor addressed filenames and property names but did not include literal string names, and property names of configuration objects (e.g. configs...)  so functions that accepted 'table' will still accept it.
Filenames change should not have any effect unless you are extending the types using TS augmentation so any `declare module '@pebula/ngrid/lib/table/...` will have to change.
For property names, all private/protected references to `table` are now `grid` and also all public references, however is most public ref's a getter was added to support the `table` property, with a `@deprecated` JSDoc annotation



# 1.0.0-rc.11 (2019-11-20)


### Bug Fixes

* **ngrid-material:** not reflecting sort state when predefined ([96611bb](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/96611bb)), closes [#61](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/issues/61)

### Bug Fixes

* **ngrid/drag:** fix row ordering issues ([2ec8dca](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/2ec8dca))

This fix allows proper move on scroll operations and in addition proper handling of row move when used in virtual scroll mode.
However, the UI placeholder in virtual scroll mode is not working properly due to lack of support in the cdk drag package.


# 1.0.0-rc.4 (2019-08-27)


### Bug Fixes

* **ngrid:** consider hz scroll on height calc in vScrollNone ([9d16a5a](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/9d16a5a))
* **ngrid:** handle height properly with vScrollNone ([fe83e5f](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/fe83e5f))



# 1.0.0-rc.3 (2019-08-26)


### Code Refactoring

* **ngrid:** deprecate `identityProp` in favor of `pIndex` ([a3edfbd](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/a3edfbd))


### Features

* **ngrid/clipboard:** add separator options ([b126951](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/b126951))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** The `identityProp` input on the grid host (`pbl-ngrid`) is now deprecated in favor of the `pIndex` property on the column definitions.
For more information, read [this doc](https://shlomiassaf.github.io/ngrid/concepts/columns/identity)
`identityProp` will be removed in version 1.0.0



# 1.0.0-rc.2 (2019-08-26)

* **ngrid:** competability with cdk 8.1.3 ([e1a9ec8](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/e1a9ec8)), closes [#37](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/issues/37)


### Code Refactoring

* **ngrid:** bump angular to version 8.2.2 ([8f82092](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/8f82092))


### BREAKING CHANGES

**ngrid:**

- This bump included a bump in TS as well, to 3.5.3. TS 3.5.3 introduces a breaking change which was fixed in this release.

- Moving from `@angular/cli 8.0.3` introduces a breaking change. The package `@ngtools/webpack@8.0.4` is now adding `ctorParameters` property to all classes with ctor params, even the non-injectable ones which now will have a hard reference leading to a circular dependency error. This release includes a refactor of the code to fit this paradigm until someone in angular understands this and push a fix...

### Code Refactoring

### Features

* **ngrid:** add new event - beforeInvalidateHeaders ([ecab8d1](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/ecab8d1))

* **ngrid/overlay-panel:** plugin that helps poping up overlay panels ([cedd949](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/ngrid/commit/cedd949))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **ngrid:** `PblNgridComponent.boxSpaceModel` was used to set the box-model strategy of the cells, either margin or padding.
Padding was the deault, when switching to margin a lot of CSS overwrites were applied and different width logic was used for column calculations. This was the case at the very start but as more and more features were added it got very hard to maintain and only padding strategy was updated and margin was not working properly, especially when used with group headers. For this reason I've decided to deprecate it as it is probably not used by anyone and adds unwanted complaxity. If it will be requried in future versions we can apply it through a plugin.
