# WIP WIP WIP

This is still work in progress!

The idea is to mimic the tools and processes in `@angular/components`.

## TODO

Once done, review the dependencies and remove everything added that is not being used.

For example:

- lerna
- semantic-release
- change log packages
- commitizen

etc...
